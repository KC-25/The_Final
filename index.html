    <h1>Immotal Plague</h1>
    <p>A mysterious plague has arisen. Immortals and Mortals have been dying everywhere. Once the plague has contaminated a being. They are connected to a hive mind to do one thing. Infect anyone and anything it can. Mortals are running and screaming in panic, while the gods shut themselves away. The plague has taken over most of the earth and the underworld is infested. The plague has reached such a point that the gods can no longer ignore it. Zeus sends down a god to find a human that is promised to save the world. What path will they choose? The way of the sky, The way of the sea, The way of the dead, or the way of the earth? Whatever they chose the fate of the world rests in their hands.</p>
