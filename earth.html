        <h6>You ask what he means, and he explains. A prophecy says that you will stop the plague or fail miserably. Gaius starts walking away. You have no choice but to follow him, knowing there will be horrible consequences if you don't.</h6>
        <h6>We walk for days. Eventually, we arrive at a spring. There are dead, infected animals and magical creatures all around the spring.</h6>
